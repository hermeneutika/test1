<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Remember when there was a
country called England? Remember when history was not a forbidden
subject? I am in the process of rediscovering my English heritage. It
has taken me over 40 years to find out about the history of the
country of my birth. I am astonished at our English history. Of
course all the haters of history and Christian England will say stop
looking backwards and deal with the now and the future. But if the
nationalist card is ever played, then what does it mean to be
English? Is nationality a choice or a fact of birth? If one must live
up to ones birthright, then this must surely include a sense of
English history. But even if one answers in the negative, the country
we call England has produced(in my opinion) some of the4 finest
examples of Christian teaching on the planet. And if one is to play
the nationalist card , then I for one, revere our ancestors and the
pinnacle of the Christian faith that they (seem to have)achieved. The
standard and the bar that they set was extremely high.   </FONT>
