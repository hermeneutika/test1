<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>If the path to true
knowledge is via the sciences and with reference to the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;
or even the empirical evidence. Then where is the empirical evidence
for climate change and/or global warming? Perhaps obviously ,if the
evidence clearly shows that the climate is being changed , then of
course,we should be concerned and do something about it!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But before we proceed down
a path of action let us be sure that we are not chasing illusions or
worse being manipulated by vested interests. Some will profit from
the path of global warming. As of course some will lose. So
unfortunately when large amounts of money are involved one has to
exercise caution. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So if one is a climate
change believer, and tv series like the Norwegian drama &ldquo;Occupied&rdquo;,
directly encourage radical direct violent action in the name of the
end justifies the means.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Ok lets assume the worst
case scenario, climate change,global warming are very real and
present dangers. (Will the Chinese,Russians,Americans,Europeans and
Indians change their ways?)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>so then sooner or later
with a person like me, the Christian faith has to factor in. When the
Almighty created the whole shebang, did He know the future? If He did
, then He knew what Mankind would do with the planet.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Surely then the prophetic
Word then becomes crucial. The Word of God even out trumps &ldquo;science&rdquo;.
This is not a question of &ldquo;argument for arguments sake&rdquo;
but a question of Truth. What is the truth of climate change and what
as Christians ought we to believe and do? Do we then go down down the
route of Extinction Rebellion? Or worse?(better?)</FONT></P>
