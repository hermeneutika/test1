Theodicy  The problem of evil and the God of love

One can perhaps dwell on the problems of a particular evil, eg the gun trade, the drugs trade, the slave trade, natural disasters, murders, tortures the list is endless. Or one can indulge in something called Christian theodicy. This does not try and solve the individual problems but attempts to generate a understanding of why such dreadful things happen in the face of the Christian claim that God is a God of love and compassion. The attempt to square the circle of dreadful evil, for example the nazi death camps, and the message of God through Jesus the Christ. Welcome to Throdicy. Elsewhere on this site I attempt to deal with the problems of substance abuse. This is of course a individual case of a particular evil. Whereas this page attempts to deal with the general problem of evil and suffering.
