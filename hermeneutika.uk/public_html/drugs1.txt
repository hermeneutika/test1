Drugs!

A hugely controversial subject. A zillion opinions on the subject. I had a recent run in with a dedicated drug and alcohol user. Which raised for me yet again the whole vexed question of both legal and illegal drug use. Of course who cares? The government? The religious institutions? Health institutions? About the only thing I can say with any certainty, as of last weekend none of the afore mention institutions had come up with a remedy! Nor anyone else for that matter. So the problem still persists. The drug cartels continue in their trade using extreme violence. The victims are still in the deadly grip of their addictions. Families and friends are traumatised by the loss of their loved ones. And yet the evil tide continues. And nothing seems to help.
