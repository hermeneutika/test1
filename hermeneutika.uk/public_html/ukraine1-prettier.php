<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Welcome to the world of
Russian/Ukrainian politics and military endeavours from my point of
view. This war which has recently kicked off has been brewing for
quite a while. Obviously hindsight is 20/20 vision. For those with
the eyes to see this war was totally predictable and preventable,IN
HINDSIGHT! But there were &ldquo;thinktanks&rdquo; out there who were
aware of the situation at least 12 months before the invasion. They
were even then advising beefing up the Ukrainian military. Here is
the link to Putin&rsquo;s speech in July 2021
