            >Welcome to the world of Russian/Ukrainian politics and military
            endeavours from my point of view. This war which has recently kicked
            off has been brewing for quite a while. Obviously hindsight is 20/20
            vision. For those with the eyes to see this war was totally
            predictable and preventable,IN HINDSIGHT! But there were
            “thinktanks” out there who were aware of the situation at least 12
            months before the invasion. They were even then advising beefing up
            the Ukrainian military. Here is the link to Putin’s speech in July
            2021
