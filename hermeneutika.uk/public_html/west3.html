<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Ok the vexed questions
keep cropping up. Douglas Murray has a new book coming out very
soon,&rdquo;The war on the West-How to prevail in an age of
unreason&rdquo;. I am a Westerner, and also white cacausian. The
&ldquo;blacks&rdquo; can say their colour with impunity,eg black
lives matter, but can I say &ldquo;white&rdquo; with equal pride? I
would be shot down in flames for racial hatred or some such nonsense.
The question of racial or colour pride. Can we equate colour with
race? Is &ldquo;race&rdquo; a religion or is it a skin tone in a
certain nanometre bandwidth? When I was at college many millenia ago,
we were &ldquo;taught&rdquo; if that is the word, TO DEFINE OUR
TERMS. So before one can begin to chat about things like race,skin
colour, religion etc. eg if one makes a comment about a popular
religion, instead of being described as a bad theologian, one is
described as a racist. Surely we are mixing up our terms. So what is
a race? And surely upon the definition of the term &ldquo;race&rdquo;
we can then go onto to define the term racism. Where do we go for
definitions? When I was at school, one went to the say the Oxford
dictionary to define ones terms. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>In the middle of all these
arguments and polemics there is of course the much neglected
discipline of LOGIC.  Which is never discussed these days. Ie if A=B
and B=C THEN A MUST EQUAL C.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>This is logic in its
simplist form. Then of course the scientific method in all its glory.
Ie the Western methadology of knowledge. The Arabs try and claim that
they invented all this. But they are wrong. Our philosophies and
theologies our mathematics, our logic, medicine etc came from the
Greeks.</FONT></P>

Count Koryzbski And his famous book &ldquo;Science and sanity&rdquo;.
