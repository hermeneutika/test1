Hermeneutics. The interpretation of texts. Very few people seem concerned with the discipline of hermeneutics. Most people seem to accept the opinions of the "experts" as a given and will not question what the so called "experts" say. I would say that this is not a problem with texts only , but with the interpretation of any sets of data including mathematical statistics. So that is that.
