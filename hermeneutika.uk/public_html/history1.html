<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>HISTORY OF
THE BIBLE AND ITS INTERPRETATION</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>After many
years of looking into the Bible and also attending various
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; institutions and listening to a lot of
various &ldquo;Christian teachers,prophets etc, and reading a lot of
books on the subject. Of course each prophet and teacher thinks or
even demands that they alone have the correct &ldquo;angle&rdquo; on
the entire subject. Criticism is just not allowed, the status quo
must be maintained at all costs. The party line must be held. I for
one need the freedom to disagree with the ruling majority. In other
words the ability to dissent from the majority view. In countries
like China,or North Korea or Russia of course dissent is forbidden.
And even in the so called democratic liberal West, it becomes harder
to challenge the status quo. But thankfully so far, not impossible.
But even in the West it is hard to say challenge climate change,or
same sex marriage, or so called gender issues. One is expected to
conform it would seem. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>The same
is true of our religious institutions it would seem. It is verboten
to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy. So what is going on? For
decades I have been saying &ldquo;faulty diagnosis, faulty solution&rdquo;.
What happens if my diagnosis of the Christian issue has been
incorrect? What happens if say Reformed Protestant fundamentalism is
actually not true? The Pentecostals have had it wrong for decades.
And then to actually challenge my own reformed &ldquo;theology&rdquo;
is a very difficult thing to do. Sola Scriptura is not then the truth
of the matter. And then perhaps the Roman Catholic position is then
correct? The Magisterium then becomes a valid source of data? Then
ones view of the Sacred Texts and their interpretations becomes a
matter of critical moment. And this  then becomes a power
relationship. One must accept the prevailing orthodoxy upon pain of
death, or worse,exclusion. The Guardians of Orthodoxy have powerful
weapons at their disposal.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But there
have been individuals in the past who have challenged orthodoxy. Not
out of a sense of rebellion but as a question of Truth. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So my
researches into the history of the Bible led me to find out that even
in the Christian Church a lot of people believe that the book of the
prophet Daniel was written late. Thus,in my view casting aspersions
on the Word of God. If one is to accept a late dating of the book of
the prophet Daniel, then one is casting doubt onto the veracity of
the Word of God. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So from a
simple desire to understand the history of the Bible, to getting
involved on a major controversy. </FONT>
