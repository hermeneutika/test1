&ldquo;The interpretation of the New Testament by Stephen Neil&rdquo;
is an interesting and informative book. It was written in the 1960s
so is a little dated now. But it does give a good exposition of the
state of Christian scholarship here in England at that time. Where
were now,if anywhere is any bodies guess. As I go through the book I
will put links to the various authors that Stephen Neil mentions. </FONT>
