PCR testing. Up to a couple of years ago very few people had heard of PCR testing. I certainly had not. My degree was an open degree but mainly in computing.

Biology and the life sciences had not really interested me. Except insofar that data from the so called life sciences were quite important in the creation/evolution debate.
So when Covid hit and i got a job in a PCR lab I ,perhaps,quite naturally became interested in the life sciences and of course PCR itself. 
I eventually got interested in the person who invented PCR and got the Nobel prize for his trouble. A man called Kary Mullis.
