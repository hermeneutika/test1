This is a video by Dr Georgia Purdom (PHd) . I find this lady very interesting. The whole question of evolution versus creation i find very interesting. The majority opinion these days is of course in the atheist/evolution camp as the most promoted explanation of life the universe and everything. Ridicule and mockery seem to be the accepted arguements of the athiest/evolution camp. In the film "Lawrence of Arabia", Lawrence and Omar Sharif and some others are in a cave discussing battle tactics. One of the participants in the scene shows his contempt for an arguement by spitting onto the ground in disgust. Quick as a flash ,Omar Sharif says "THAT IS NOT A ARGUMENT". How true. One may hold certain opinions to be beneath contempt, but to hold something in contempt, is not a rebuttal.
